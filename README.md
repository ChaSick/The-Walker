# The Walker

Welcome to the early development stage of **The Walker** — my personal project built in Unity. This game is a passion project I’m working on in my free time, with the vision of eventually releasing a polished and immersive experience.

At the moment, I am sharing the **alpha version** of the game. Please note that this build is an early prototype, and while it showcases the core mechanics and concept, it has not undergone thorough testing. Many bugs remain unresolved, and some features are still under development.

I kindly ask for your understanding and constructive feedback as I continue to refine and improve the project. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work!

### About the Project
- **Engine:** Unity
